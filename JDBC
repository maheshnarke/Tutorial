 The JDBC API consists of the following core parts:

    JDBC Drivers
    Connections  :: Connection connection =  DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);
    Statements   : Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
    Result Sets  :: String sql = "select * from people";
                    ResultSet result = statement.executeQuery(sql);
                  To update/delete database instead of calling the executeQuery() method, you call the executeUpdate() method. 
                  Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
                  String    sql       = "update people set name='John' where id=123";
                  int rowsAffected    = statement.executeUpdate(sql);
    
 There are 4 different types of JDBC drivers:

    Type 1: JDBC-ODBC bridge driver
    Type 2: Java + Native code driver
    Type 3: All Java + Middleware translation driver
    Type 4: All Java driver
    
    
    A java.sql.CallableStatement is used to call stored procedures in a database.
